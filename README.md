This tool is an expansion on the popular tool **TOFUGU** https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/

I want to make a hands free version that will allow users to "quiz" their skills whilst doing chores around the house e.g. washing dishes.
The goal is to make the quiz section voice controlled, so you can use "TOFUGU" HANDS FREE => HFTOFU! 
This application was made for myself but I wish to share the code and the website with everyone when I can soon!
**This is a work in progress**


(Works best on native chrome browser, brave my pose issues due to enhanced blocking features)
